<!-- Managed by https://github.com/linkorb/repo-ansible. Manual changes will be overwritten. -->

Ansible playbooks with templated configuration to apply to all LinkORB code repositories.

What benefits do you get from using repo-ansible for your repository?

 - **CodeSpace devcontainers**<br>
   LAMP-based devcontainer with Apache, MariaDB and a phpMyAdmin.
 - **automated security and dependency updates via Dependabot**<br>
   Organization-wide settings ensure security alerts and pull requests are enabled for all repositories,
   and repo-ansible, doubles down on this configuration, makes sure that security and minor version updates
   created by Dependabot will automatically get merged.
 - **Contributors support**<br>
   Community guidelines, contributing notes, git hooks, codeowners for automated PR assignment, QA tooling/configuration,
   and the standardized LinkORB pull request template.
 - **Standardized repository files, GitHub repository management, and much more to come!**


## Quick start

Ensure that Docker is installed on your system and you are using either Linux, MacOS, or WSL under Windows.

Create and configure a  `repo.yaml` file for your repository. Reference the
[configuration table below](#short-reference-configuration) and the associated repo.schema.yaml file.

Run repo-ansible for your project via docker:

```shell
# always pull latest version first
docker pull ghcr.io/linkorb/repo-ansible:latest
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/app ghcr.io/linkorb/repo-ansible:latest
```

> This command will execute the repo-ansible playbook-cwd.yaml in your current directory and report on the tasks
> that reported changes throughout the execution.


> [!NOTE]
> During execution your repository's' **README.md will be overwritten** with the generation rules used in repo-ansible.
> If you're running the playbook for the first time on your repository, be sure to
> review [Readme file auto-generation](#readme-file-auto-generation)

### Running repo-ansible playbooks manually

Ansible is required.
[How do I install Ansible on my system?](./docs/AnsibleInstallation.md)
[Encountered issues with Ansible execution?](./docs/AnsibleInstallation.md#Debugging-Ansible-issues)

Grab the latest version of the repository and its dependencies.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/linkorb/repo-ansible.git /tmp/repo-ansible

$ pip3 install jsonschema
```

**Run the playbook**


```shell
/your-repository $ ansible-playbook /tmp/repo-ansible/playbook-cwd.yaml

PLAY [localhost] **************************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ********************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

...
```

The playbook will load and validate `repo.yaml` according to the schema; then proceed to apply templates and checks to
your repository.

### Readme file auto-generation

The content for each section of this README was either retrieved from `repo.yaml` or Markdown partials stored in the
`docs/partials` folder. Managing content in this way allows you to define repo-specific content in
`repo.yaml` and within the `/docs/partials` folder as Markdown partials.

For example, if you define `readme.usage.content` in `repo.yaml`, but a Markdown file named `readme.usage.md` exists
in the `/docs` folder, the dynamic README inserts the Markdown content.

To make this possible, tasks defined in `retrieve-docs-data.yaml` retrieve the docs files data such as the filename
and path for each Markdown file so `README.md.j2` can check for the presence of Markdown files for each README section
and insert Markdown content if there is a match.
