# repo-ansible

Ansible playbooks with templated configuration to apply to all LinkORB code repositories.

What benefits do you get from using repo-ansible for your repository?

- **CodeSpace devcontainers**<br>
  LAMP-based devcontainer with Apache, MariaDB and a phpMyAdmin.
- **automated security and dependency updates via Dependabot**<br>
  Organization-wide settings ensure security alerts and pull requests are enabled for all repositories,
  and repo-ansible, doubles down on this configuration, makes sure that security and minor version updates
  created by Dependabot will automatically get merged.
- **Contributors support**<br>
  Community guidelines, contributing notes, git hooks, codeowners for automated PR assignment, QA tooling/configuration,
  and the standardized LinkORB pull request template.
- **Standardized repository files, GitHub repository management, and much more to come!**

## Get Started

### Configure

The playbook depends on the `repo.yml` configuration file which must reside at the root of your repository.
This configuration let's you define variables that are used throughout generation of repository files, workflows,
and in general standardisation across the organization repositories.

For example, you use `repo.yml` to define your projects repository name, description, license, visibility, code owners,
etc.

For all the options and switches, please refer to the JSON Schema definition of the configuration file:
[repo.schema.yaml](repo.schema.yaml).

#### Define README docs section content

The content for each section of this README was either retrieved from `repo.yaml` or Markdown partials stored in the
`docs/partials` folder. Managing content in this way allows you to centrally define documentation in
`repo.schema.yaml` inherited by each affected codebase while also allowing you to define repo-specific content in
`repo.yaml` and within the `/docs/partials` folder as Markdown partials.

When a playbook generates the README, it checks for Markdown partials in the `/docs` folder. If present, they override
repo-specific content defined in `repo.yaml` or content inherited from `repo.schema.yaml` defaults.

For example, if you define `readme.usage.content` in `repo.yaml`, but a Markdown file named `readme.usage.md` exists
in the `/docs` foder, the dynamic README inserts the Markdown content.

To make this possible, tasks defined in `retrieve-docs-data.yaml` retrieve the docs files data such as the filename
and path for each Markdown file so `README.md.j2` can check for the presence of Markdown files for each README section
and insert Markdown content if there is a match.

### Install repo-ansible and its dependencies

Ansible is required.
[How do I install Ansible on my system?](./docs/AnsibleInstallation.md)
[Encountered issues with Ansible execution?](./docs/AnsibleInstallation.md#Debugging-Ansible-issues)

Grab the latest version of the repository and its dependencies.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/linkorb/repo-ansible.git /tmp/repo-ansible

$ pip3 install -r /tmp/repo-ansible/requirements.txt
```

### Run the playbook

> [!NOTE]
> During execution your repository's' **README.md will be overwritten** with the generation rules used in repo-ansible.
> If you're running the playbook for the first time on your repository, be sure to
> _Review README.md file auto-generation, switches and rules_ â†‘

```shell
/your-repository $ ansible-playbook /tmp/repo-ansible/playbook-cwd.yaml

PLAY [localhost] **************************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ********************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

...
```

The playbook will load and validate `repo.yaml` according to the schema; then proceed to apply templates and checks to
your repository.

### Running with Docker

You can run `repo-ansible` using Docker to avoid installing Ansible and its dependencies locally.

#### Steps

1. **Build the Docker image** from the root of the `repo-ansible` repository:

   ```bash
   docker build -t repo-ansible .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container** in your repository:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your-repository
   docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/app repo-ansible
   ```

   Ensure that `repo.yaml` is present in the root of your repository. This command mounts your current repository into the Docker container and runs the Ansible playbook.
